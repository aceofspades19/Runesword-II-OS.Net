SPH: TLC by Monty.
This is starting to shape up.  I'm working on the feeling of the tome, trigger work, and the monsters.
Any suggestions on how I can implement anything let me know.


Things to do in SPH:
rescue prisoners
finish quests (so far three work)
get the Snake Pipe (need to expand upon this)
kill Gir-lak and Fil-ith. (still working on beefing them up)
talk to the duck

version 1.4.3
fixed prisoners
added comments here and there
added convo to chained demon (start only)
set andrea's conversation to work.
worked on Plinths

Need to do:
create and add more monsters and encounters
work on items and graphics (statues would be good)
work on quest elements and more background
make spirits and spirit quest work!
broos (need major tweaks)
use sounds (my docs, unofficial, my music)
make donation to glaswall mean something
work on guard of tomb
finish scorp quest
