Telluria, vol. 1 - The Heir of the Dead.

This was supposed to be just a first part of something apparently 
simple (in my mind).  Due to cutting it short, there are definitely
a couple of loose ends.  For those I apologize.  But thre is a huge 
amount of room to expand this.  

I purposely did not try to end this by attaching triggers to make 
it a continuing story.

My goal is to have several more tomes - now that my creator skills are 
improving.

Not in any specific order these are ideas I have outlines already 
done for - all based on the large Telluria map in the Tome.

The Women of fire
City in the Clouds
Fog in the North
Lost city of the Olani
Intrique in the Twin Cities
Beyond the Dike

For this tome, the bmp's that start with t_ need to be in the data
folder.  t_sarcaphagus is just cut from one of the existing tile sets.
t_MageFemStaff2.bmp is not mine, but I lost the name of the original
file in my library so I needed to include the file with this name.

The others are new I think.  

The ship, Rave, Marcel, and Serena bmp's all need to be in the Tome folder.

Credits -

Way to many inclusions of help/maps/triggers/creatures to get everyone 
but there are some blatant uses that I must acknowledge.

The guildmasters are obviously directly modified from Shodan's Skytos Guild 
Hall.  

The Magic shop and Mercantile store are modified from Jack's Lantern.

The Temple in The city is modified from The Land Beyond.

The Portmasters Building is modified, I think, from the BlackDeath Tome.  Can't 
remember for sure though???

I think those are the direct uses of others work.  Thanks also to Shodan, Monty, 
VD, and a couple of others on the boards who continually humor my questions about
graphics and runescript.
