version 1.0.0
graphics still missing


version 1.0.1
first sweepthrough for missing graphics.  Used SCR_015 for most of the missing ones.

version 1.0.5
created camp and undrgrnd tilesets.  they need a little work still.
created a few more encounters on the main map
working on fletching skill, arrows still buggy
worked on movecreatures, works properly now
added in backstory
worked on conversations
fixed camp encounters


1. The fletching skill - needs to use up the materials - can make arrows indefinitely. 

Also, this trigger needs to be set to one-time - it is infinite now - caused trouble leaving the area (would not have mattered if not for problem 3)
