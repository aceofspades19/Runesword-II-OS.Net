Temple of Dagon
by Count0

This is my first tome and is actually intended as part 4 in a 5 part campaign exiting all within the larger Valley of Lemuria Tome to come.  As such, please keep in mind that there may be elements better explained in the larger tome.  If (read "when") you find bugs or RS1-sixed graphics please email me at wilbur_whatley@hotmail.com so I can fix them for future release(s).

Thanks, enjoy, and remember to play with the lights off.
