Modifications to triggers
-------------------------
- added a missing Next statement in "Johan awards party"
- updated the ExecTrigger statement in "return home" (added "Johan awards party")
- rewrote the trigger completely (replaced the ForEach/Next loop by a Find CreatureA condition)
- changed the timing for "return home" from Post-StepEncounter to Post-EnterEncounter
- changed the duration for "Johan's wife" from Infinite to One Time
- moved "Find Marial" from Encounter to Topic "Who is Klythan"
- added a topic when the party brings her back home



Convos
------
- Added a few Post-Topic triggers here and there.
- prevented some topics from being displayed if previous information was not known to the party.



Quests
------
Johan's wife:
- Probable cause for the quest not being completed was the Post-StepEncounter 
timing. The above modifications now give expected results.


Destroy Klythan:
- The original tome had no trigger to check if this quest was fulfilled. This is 
now updated (a new convo has been added, and a post-topic trigger checks if 
Klythan is dead).
- Extra experience points awarded if the party finds who is responsible for the turmoil.
- Added a "congratulations" party when quest is completed.
