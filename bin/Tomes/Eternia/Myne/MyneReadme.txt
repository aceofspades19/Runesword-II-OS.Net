All the graphics either came with the game, were downloaded off of Shrapnel Forums, or (in a few cases) are edits by me off of graphics that came with the game or from Shrapnel Forums; in a very few cases, I built the graphics from scratch with a rendering program.

Banking is now more stable, but also less flexible; it no longer uses Creature's Money property for much of anything, and so avoids high-number crashes.  However, when reporting the amount you have in savings, or processing the amount of money on your person, it caps the value off at 32000.  Also, when reading the amount of money you currently have, it only reads the money you have in your main inventory, not that which you have in containers.

Description:
Myne is a peaceful town - if you ignore the Arena, the werewolves that wander at night, the nearby Amazon village, and the dragon caves.  At present, there are five simple quests to do, and a very powerful entity who can join you.

Hunger and fatigue have been implemented in this tome as options.
An optional safety net has been put in place.
You can now purchase and build on a plot of land; buildings and items left there (once purchased) will remain stable until the tome is reset.
