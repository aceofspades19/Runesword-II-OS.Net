List of changes by Monty
added in let local fail = global trueline when finding axe to cut trees down with
added skeletons into cupboard
worked on map for tower second floor

Things to do:
On Island of Phoenix rest map, in trailmaker encounter, if you search for an axe, find one and get trail made, the other trigger keeps telling you that you do not have an axe to cut the trees down with. Need someway to turn that trigger off.

Trigger-related bugs
--------------------
1. Aleysia never finds anyone to dance with her.
Reason: I don't know... Anyway, I replaced the code:
"ForEach CreatureA In Party
If CreatureA.IsMale = Global.True
And CreatureA.Money > Pos.1"
by:
"ForEach CreatureA In Party
If CreatureA.IsMale = Global.False
Or CreatureA.Money < Pos.50
DialogShow "Aleysia" BriefBox Says "Sorry, [CreatureA.Name], you're not my type!"
Else"

2. If you're candidate for suicide, you fall from the tower... and find you're 
finally in front of the entrance, without having being hurt at all. In addition, 
if you jump out, everyone in the party dies. Pretty harsh, huh?
Reason: I think the EndIf and Next statements are inverted.
Previous code:
"If Local.IntegerA <= CreatureA.Intelligence
DialogShow "DM" Normal Says "Successful Roll. You over come the urge to jump out the open door."
Else                               <------ Condition
DialogShow "DM" Normal Says "Failed Roll. You can't stand the urge any more and jump out the open door. As you jump you change your mind but are to late. Flailing wildly you grab at the rest of the party but pull them with you."
MoveParty To "The Island of Phoenix Rest" At (Pos.33, Pos.1)
ForEach CreatureA In EncounterNow  <------ Loop
Put CreatureA.Health = Neg.5 Into CreatureA.Health       <--- Too bad. Everybody dies
EndIf                              <------- Condition
Next                               <------- Loop "
Now:
"If Local.IntegerA <= CreatureA.Intelligence
DialogShow "DM" Normal Says "Successful Roll. You over come the urge to jump out the open door."
Else                               <------ Condition
DialogShow "DM" Normal Says "Failed Roll. You can't stand the urge any more and jump out the open door. As you jump you change your mind but are to late. Flailing wildly you grab at the rest of the party but pull them with you."
MoveParty To "The Island of Phoenix Rest" At (Pos.33, Pos.1)
ForEach CreatureA In Party         <------- Loop
Put CreatureA.Health - Dice.5d12+5 Into CreatureA.Health   <--- You still have a chance that someone survives. Has he any "First Aid" skill? That's another story.
Next                               <------- Loop
Exit Loop           <--- No need to continue checking if someone's already jumped!
EndIf                              <------ Condition
Next"

3. In the schools (Lore And Magic as well as Weapons And Armour), you could get
as many free skills as you wanted (no gold spent!). And provided that one
character could pay, all the party would benefit! In addition if you already had 
the selected skill, well, then you would get it one more time...
Reason:
- to make sure gold is spent, I replaced the code:
"CopyText "1000" Into Local.TextA
ForEach CreatureA In Party
If CreatureA.Money >= Local.TextA
CopyText "-1000" Into Local.TextA
Let CreatureA.Money = Local.TextA"
by (with Local.IntegerC set at 250):
"Put Local.IntegerC * Pos.4 Into Local.IntegerB
ForEach CreatureA In Party
If CreatureA.Money >= Local.IntegerB
Put CreatureA.Money - Local.IntegerB Into CreatureA.Money"

- to make sure that only those with funds would gain new skills:
"If CreatureA.Money >= Local.TextA
CopyText "-1000" Into Local.TextA
Let CreatureA.Money = Local.TextA
Exit Loop  <----See? If one pays, everybody gets the skill
EndIf"
was changed to
"If CreatureA.Money >= Local.IntegerB
Put CreatureA.Money - Local.IntegerB Into CreatureA.Money
Else
DialogShow "Master Armourer says" Normal Says "[CreatureA.Name] does not have enough gold"
EndIf"

- to prevent characters from having the skill twice (and therefore pay for
nothing), I rewrote the trigger and its sub-triggers. First, the subtrigger is 
called each time a character has paid for the skill:
"Case Pos.1
DialogShow "Master Armourer" Normal Says "This course will cost you 1000 gold pieces and will take 5 days to learn."
CopyText "1000" Into Local.TextA
ForEach CreatureA In Party
If CreatureA.Money >= Local.TextA
CopyText "-1000" Into Local.TextA
Let CreatureA.Money = Local.TextA
Exit Loop
EndIf
Next
Put Tome.TimeDay + Pos.5 Into Tome.TimeDay
ExecTrigger "Battle Armor" "
is now:
"Case Pos.1
DialogShow "Master Armourer" Normal Says "This course will cost you 1250 gold pieces and will take 5 days to learn."
Put Local.IntegerC * Pos.5 Into Local.IntegerB
ForEach CreatureA In Party
If CreatureA.Money >= Local.IntegerB
Put CreatureA.Money - Local.IntegerB Into CreatureA.Money
Set CreatureNow = CreatureA
ExecTrigger "Battle Armor"
Else
DialogShow "Master Armourer says" Normal Says "[CreatureA.Name] does not have enough gold"
EndIf
Next
Put Tome.TimeDay + Pos.5 Into Tome.TimeDay"

And the subtrigger is totally new, as follows. The code:
"ForEach CreatureA In Party
CopyTrigger  Into CreatureA    <--- By the way, this couldn't work: copy what?
Next"
has been rewritten to become:
"CopyText "Battle Armor" Into TriggerB.Name
ForEach TriggerA In CreatureNow
If TriggerA.Name = TriggerB.Name
Put TriggerA.SkillPoints + Pos.11 Into TriggerA.SkillPoints
DialogShow "Master Armourer says" Normal Says "[CreatureNow.Name] has improved his battle armour skill."
Exit Trigger
Else
Next
EndIf
CopyTrigger "Battle Armor" Into CreatureNow
DialogShow "Master Armourer" Normal Says "[CreatureNow.Name] is now able to wear an armour."  "
With this updated trigger:
a) you only get level 1 of the new skill (and not the max as before)
b) if you already have the skill, you gain one level (possible bug there: I didn'
t check if the max. level was already reached. When I explained improvements 
were possible, here is one!)
c) the same was done for "Lore Master", "Wizard Master" and "Weapons Master"


Map-related bugs
----------------
1. Hermit's hut leads nowhere (well, yes: exit of the game!)
Reason: the entry point links to "Area: Main menu"!
Fix: create an encounter "Hermit's hut". What I did for the time being is copy 
and paste the Huntsman Cottage from Area2. What happens inside? At the moment, 
nothing. Another improvement here!

2. The left ladder (21,27) down in the lava tubes behaves similarly
Reason: the entry point links to "Area: Random", "Map in Area" and "EntryPoint
on Map" are empty.
Fix: Area = Area1, Map in Area = Pit, EntryPoint on Map = climb up

3. Even though you haven't been given the quest to heal Veld, someone with the
Picklock skill can open the doors in Arun's house and get the Exp. for 
completing the quest. I therefore modified the EndQuest trigger (and also to 
take into account the additional quest from the Potion Merchant, see below).

4. In Area2, "The Deep Regions", most (if not all) encounters had invisible 
dwarves. Also the Shadow Dragon - I missed it completely when I played the tome! 
I probably left some others as well. The encounters should all be visible now.

5. Well, not really a bug, but I think apart from the Doppelganger and the 
Huntsman the other encounters should be wandering monsters. It's very easy to 
avoid them when you see where they are! And another possible improvement...


Additions and possible developments to the tome
-----------------------------------------------
1. Aleysia : even if she robbed you, you wouldn't want to kill her. Anyway, in a 
crowded inn, that's not something to do (but you still can, and nobody will send 
you to jail for that. Unless another trigger fires - you could be freed on the 
condition that you find out what happened to Hermit. Great! Another possible 
improvement...
So, suppose you spared her life. Of course you won't dance again with her, so
another Aleysia appears in that case. If you were so kind as to let her live,
you will gain (from the Bartender, a new encounter I created for that purpose) a 
special ring. Why not link this ring to Hermit's disparition? Let's see it that 
way: you kill Aleysia, you must find where Hermit's gone. You let her live, you 
are asked by the Bartender to find his friend Hermit, and he gives you a ring to 
help you with your quest.
2. Just for the story, I updated the Potion Merchant encounter: added a quest (
find if his brothers are really dead), developed the conversation with regard to 
that, modified Aruns' quest results accordingly.
Basically, here's the background:
- Arun would like to heal his friend and needs the Lifegiver
- the Potion Merchant would like to be given the Lifegiver back
Solution (unknown to the player): fulfill Arun's quest first!
3. Veld explains (when he's finally healed) that he now seeks revenge and wants 
to kill the monster that hex him. Where is this monster? What is it? Cool, we 
can add other additions there!
4. What are these famous Bones of power? We could either relate them to Hermit's 
disappearance (his bones?) or create a totally new quest.
5. What happens to Veld if it takes longer than five days to heal him?
