The Land Beyond by Dan and Adam, rev. 2.2

Changes by Titi, Feb 2006

Fixed the pit trap trigger (in the tower), which was not executed entirely (problem with too many If/EndIf pairs).


Changes by Titi, Jan 2005

Thanks to Phule for correcting Dune Hound, Fencing, Ambidex and Backstab, to José, monty and PaleoT for listing the bugs.


Fixes:
------
+ Items:
  - Potions self-destroy mechanism not working if use in combat: added test in trigger to check if InCombat or not, and modified code accordingly.
  - Orb of Slavery having no effect on the Eternal: code corrected (now looking for "The Eternal")
  - Arrows now all cause the same damages (3d4 for long arrows, 2d4 for short ones)

+ Creatures:
  - Dune Hound attacking endlessly: code corrected (CreatureNow.ActionPoints decrease after each attack).
  - Wizards not fighting: corrected code to allow them to attack with weapons 25% of the time ; also updated sub-triggers to be in line with their school.
  - Gold Dragon giving more Health to the Eternal than it has: added test to limit healing to the dragon current health
  - Lich (Master and Servant): see 'wizards'
  - Sea Mage and Strange Assistant: see 'wizards'
  - scientists: see 'wizards'
  - Yokel could die even if you didn't choose to (this was possible if the combat lasted more than 4 turns or if he has already been killed once: the second time was definitive). Changed duration of Pre-Death trigger from 'one time' to 'infinite' and allowed combat to last longer (with self-destroy mechanism of the involved trigger not to fire in future fights).

+ Skills:
  - Fencing never disarms your opponent: fixed
  - Backstab can kill even at a distance: fixed
  - Finger of Death can affect undead and animals: fixed
  - Secondary weapon (Ambidex skill) always dealing 0 damage: fixed

+ Encounters:
  - changed some timing (from Infinite to One Time and vice versa)


Improvements:
-------------
+ Added a Pre-Turn trigger on some creatures (see Kingsmen Captain or Durge) to allow them to drink healing potions if they're badly hurt in combat
+ Added the map of the tower (south of the island)
+ Added a surprise to the bubbling potion found in the volcano entry level (encounter "And another thing")
+ Added factoids, topics and a few triggers to let the party discover the events at the Baron's house.
+ Modified Cutter's training: a random thief skill may now be gained in addition to the backstab skill level increase.
+ Added consequences of 'slaughtering' the yokel...
+ Automatic update of 'Fencing', 'Backstab', 'Ambidex' and 'Finger of Death'.
+ Added consistency to items (same name and particulars --> same picture).
+ Added an encounter and some developments to prepare The Kyparissian Scientist, "sequel" of TLB.
