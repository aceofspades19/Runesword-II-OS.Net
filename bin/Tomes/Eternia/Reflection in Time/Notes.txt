Reflection in Time 
v. 1.0 
Travis Smith (PaleoT)



This idea for this Tome was partially derived watching Time Bandits.  
Although, once again my imagination outruns my ability.  Any input 
on ways to improve triggers etc is more than welcome,

This is a tome for up to 4 characters that are pretty much straight 
out of The Land Beyond.  I take no credit for any tilesets included.
I only do so to make sure everyone has what I used.  DO NOT write them
over your own files in case I messed them up.  Item and creature graphics 
with a "_t" at the end I made from images I had.  The others I included 
are from the  mesage board but I have not seen them used very often.


I had tons of help on triggers from the usual suspects in the mod forum -

monty, Shodan, and Phule in particular - Thanks -
