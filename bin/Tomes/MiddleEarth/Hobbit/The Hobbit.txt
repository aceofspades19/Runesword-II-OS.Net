I decided to create a Runesword Tome of 'The Hobbit'
because it's just possible that Runesword was based
on 'The Hobbit' or a book in that genre. So here it is,
'The Hobbit' tome in all its glory, ready for you to play!

BTW, I don't know exactly how to make the tomes available to
play,so you might have to edit it slightly. Apart from that, I
don't think there are any bugs in it. If you find one
e-mail me at BAReay@compuserve.com.
I hope you like the tome!

WIP's:
battle of five armies
need to put in dwarves leaving right after the code below...
Still not sure about the Green Dragon map or the horses. 



1. Shire - Gandalf/Thorin hire Bilbo- other dwarves join (more or less done) 

2. Troll encounter in the wilderness - get magic weapons (more or less done) 

4. Rivendel - Elrond (more or less done) 

5. Misty Mountains - Goblin Caves (in process -more caves here) 

6. (This is tough for RS) Separated - Dwarves escape, Bilbo meets Gollum and escapes a different way - finds ring (more or less done) 

7. East side of mountains - Fight with Wargs and Goblins - rescued by Eagles (more or less there) 

8. Eagles take them to the Carrock - find Beorn (more or less done) 

9. Mirkwood - Spiders (more or less done) 

10. The campfire and singing was actually the Elves of Mirkwood 

11. Imprisoned by the Elves - King Thranduil? (Legolas' father I believe) (I saw part of this, but the idea is in place) 

*after this I have not looked at in the tome 

12. Escape in Barrels to the Lakemen (more or less done)

13. Go to the mountain - piss the dragon off (needs work)

14. Bard kills the dragon - Dwarves get greedy (this is where the Arkenstone comes in) 

15. Big battle - (five armies, etc.) not started yet
Bilbo goes home


The spiders in Mirkwood - they give multiple doses of poison - pretty much wipe out the party in just a couple of rounds - maybe limit them from adding more poison if the character already is poisoned. 


Suggestions: 

The story has the Dwarves get cornered by goblins ans wargs and rescued by the Eagles and carried to the Carrock and Beorn, from there they go into the forest. 

part of code to use at end of dwarves...

' Haven't found any alive yet 
Let Local.IntegerA = Pos.0 
' search through party 
ForEach CreatureA in Party 
' alive? 
If CreatureA.Health > Pos.0 
' Live! 
' dwarf? 
IfText CreatureA.Race Like "Dwarf" 
' Live Dwarf!  Count it. 
Put Pos.1 + Local.IntegerA Into Local.IntegerA 
EndIf 
EndIf 
Next 
' now Local.IntegerA contains a count 
' of the live dwarves in the party. 
' You will want to remove the dwarves 
' from the party before rewarding experience. 
' Otherwise, the dwarves will soak up some 
' of the reward, and it may end up being 
' less rewarding for them all to survive!
